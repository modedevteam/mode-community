# Mode Community

Welcome to the Mode Community repository! This is the central hub for tracking issues, discussions, and feature requests related to Mode, the first client-only AI code copilot that connects directly to the language models you trust.

## About Mode

Mode is built to keep developers in control of their coding experience, connecting directly with AI providers like Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and Mistral.

With Mode, you bring your own API keys, customize settings, and ensure that your data remains private and secure.
